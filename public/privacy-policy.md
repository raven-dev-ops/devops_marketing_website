# Privacy Policy for Raven AI Assistant

Last updated: November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Raven Development Operations LLC (“Raven”, “we”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Raven AI Assistant on this site or through connected apps. By using the assistant you agree to this policy.

## Information We Collect
- Contact details you provide (name, email, company, role, preferences).
- Prompts, messages, uploads, and other content you submit to the assistant, plus related usage logs.
- Technical data such as browser type, device identifiers, IP address, pages viewed, and timestamps.
- Cookies or similar technologies for authentication, session management, and basic analytics.

## How We Use Information
- Operate, secure, and improve the Raven AI Assistant and related support services.
- Generate responses, troubleshoot issues, and provide customer support.
- Monitor abuse, prevent fraud, and enforce acceptable use.
- Comply with legal obligations and maintain business records.

We do not sell your personal information.

## AI Processing and Third Parties
The assistant may use third-party model providers or infrastructure to process your prompts and files. Those vendors handle data under their own terms and privacy policies. We share only what is needed to deliver the requested response and configure services to minimize retention where options exist.

## How Information Is Shared
- With service providers that host, analyze, or support the assistant under confidentiality obligations.
- With your direction (for example, if you integrate other tools or share conversation links).
- To comply with law, respond to legal process, or protect rights, security, and safety.
- As part of a business transaction (such as a merger or acquisition), subject to this policy.
- In aggregate or de-identified form that does not reasonably identify you.

## Data Retention
We retain personal information only as long as needed to provide the assistant, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and maintain security records. Conversation content and logs may be stored for a limited period to improve reliability, detect abuse, and support your requests. When retention is no longer needed, we delete or anonymize the data.

## Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the information we hold. No system is perfectly secure, so please choose carefully what you share with the assistant and protect your accounts and devices.

## Your Choices and Rights
- Request access to, correction of, or deletion of personal information we hold about you.
- Opt out of non-essential communications via unsubscribe links or by contacting us.
- Limit cookies through your browser settings (some features may rely on them).
- Stop using the assistant; you may also ask us to close related accounts.

Contact: [business@ravdevops.com](mailto:business@ravdevops.com) to exercise these choices.

## International Transfers
We may process and store information in the United States and other countries where our service providers operate. We take steps to protect information in accordance with applicable law when it is transferred across borders.

## Children
The Raven AI Assistant is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe a child has provided us information, contact us so we can delete it.

## Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will post a notice in the assistant or on this page. Continued use after an update means you accept the revised policy.
