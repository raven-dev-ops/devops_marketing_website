# Terms of Service for Raven AI Assistant

Last updated: November 2025

These Terms of Service govern your access to and use of the Raven AI Assistant provided by Raven Development Operations LLC (“Raven”, “we”, “us”). By using the assistant you agree to these terms. If you are using it on behalf of a company, you represent you have authority to bind that company.

## Eligibility and Accounts
You must be at least 18 and legally able to form a contract. Keep your credentials confidential and you are responsible for activity under your account.

## Permitted Use
- Use the assistant only for lawful purposes and consistent with these terms.
- Do not input sensitive personal data, regulated data, or content you lack rights to share.
- Do not exploit, attack, or reverse engineer the service or underlying models.
- Do not rely on outputs for high-risk scenarios (for example, medical, safety-critical, or legal decisions) without independent review by a qualified professional.

## Your Content
You retain ownership of the prompts, files, and other content you submit. You grant Raven a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use that content to operate, secure, and improve the assistant, to comply with law, and to provide support you request. You are responsible for ensuring your content and use comply with laws and third-party rights.

## Outputs and No Professional Advice
AI-generated outputs may be incorrect, incomplete, or inappropriate. The assistant does not provide legal, financial, medical, safety, or other professional advice. You must review outputs and are solely responsible for how you use them.

## Third-Party Services
The assistant may rely on third-party hosting, analytics, and model providers. Their terms and policies govern your use of those services. Raven is not liable for third-party platforms outside its control.

## Fees
If any features carry fees, pricing and billing terms will be provided separately. You agree to pay applicable charges and taxes for paid features you choose to use.

## Intellectual Property
Raven and its licensors retain all rights to the assistant, documentation, branding, and underlying technology. These terms do not grant you ownership; only a limited right to use the service as permitted here.

## Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions, you allow Raven to use them without restriction or obligation to you.

## Termination
You may stop using the assistant at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations of these terms, to protect the service, or as required by law. Provisions that by nature should survive termination will continue to apply.

## Disclaimers
THE RAVEN AI ASSISTANT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” RAVEN DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RAVEN WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL. RAVEN’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE ASSISTANT IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 3 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM (OR USD $100 IF NO FEES WERE PAID).

## Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Raven and its officers, directors, employees, and contractors from any claims, damages, or costs arising from your content, your use of the assistant, or your breach of these terms.

## Governing Law
Unless a different governing law is agreed in writing, these terms are governed by the laws of the State of Missouri, United States, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Any disputes will be handled in the courts located in Missouri.

## Changes
We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. If changes are material, we will post a notice in the assistant or on this page. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
